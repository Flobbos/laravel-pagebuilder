## Pull Requests 

Looks like you want to help out on vue-select.. awesome! Here's a couple things to keep in mind when contributing.

1. If your PR contains multiple commits, try to keep those commits succinct, with descriptive messages. This makes it easier to understand your thought process.
2. Don't run the build before submitting. The build is only run and committed immediately before a new release, and submitting a PR with a build included is just more to parse. 
3. If your PR fixes or references an open issue, be sure to reference it in your message.
4. If you're adding new functionality, make sure your code has good test coverage.

:tada: Thanks for contributing, and an even bigger thanks for reading these guidelines!
